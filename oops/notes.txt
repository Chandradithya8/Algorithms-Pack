scope resolution operator

1. access the static member in a class
2. when different class have the same function or variable name during 		  
	inheritace
3. declare the function inside the class and define it outside the class


virtual function

-> should be accessed via pointer or reference
-> cannot be static

1. early binding -> function overridden at the compile time (non - virtual functions)
2. Late binding -> function overridden at the run time (virtual functions)


dynamic binding
